Hi there,
​
I started Non Finito first on [Medium](https://medium.com/history-of-art), as a space dedicated to musings on art and art history. 
​
As an art history graduate working in the business world, where I had less to do with beautiful paintings and more to do with charts, I felt that I was slowly losing grips with the subject matter of my university years. So I created a space where I can store my reading notes on books, exhibition reviews and impressions, travel logs from cultural trips, and my thoughts on visual culture in general.
​
This is how Non Finito came to be. 
​
I hope you'll find as much pleasure in reading it, as I found whilst writing it.
​
Yours, 
​
Liviu
